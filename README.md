# Logic Gates using Neural Networks 🧠🔌

This project demonstrates how classic logic gates — **AND**, **OR**, **NAND**, and **XOR** — can be implemented using neural networks. Built with Python and NumPy, it showcases both **single-layer perceptrons** and a simple **two-layer neural network** for the XOR gate.

## 🧠 Gates Implemented

| Gate | Type | Implementation |
|------|------|----------------|
| AND  | Single Layer | Perceptron with sigmoid |
| OR   | Single Layer | Perceptron with sigmoid |
| NAND | Single Layer | Perceptron with sigmoid |
| XOR  | Two Layer | Combination of NAND, OR → AND |
